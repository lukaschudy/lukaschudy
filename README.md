## Hi there 👋

## My name is Lukas and I am an ex League of Legends pro player, who is now pursuing a degree in Economics & Math at RUG with an exchange at HKUST. My passion lies in probability theory which is the topic I will pursue further in my MSc degree next year.
## As far as coding goes, my primarily laguage is C++, I love the fact that it teaches me better coding habits than python although python is great as well, I have public open-source projects planned in game theory, so stay tuned :)
