### Hi there 👋 I'm Lukas.

**Ex-Professional League of Legends Player turned Quant.**

Currently pursuing a double-focus in **Economics & Mathematics** at the University of Groningen (RUG) and HKUST. Also spent last Summer doing Math/Stats at LSE.

My background in competitive esports taught me rapid decision-making, and now, I apply that rigor to **Probability Theory** and **Game Theory**.

* 🔭 **Current Focus:** Stochastic Models & Game Theory.
* 💻 **Primary Language:** **C++**. I prefer **C++** because it enforces strict coding habits and structural discipline, skills that are often abstracted away in high-level languages. (But python is great as well :))
* 🔜 **Coming Soon:** Open-source projects in Game Theory simulations.

* 📫 **Reach out:** [lukaschudy@hotmail.com](mailto:lukaschudy@hotmail.com)
