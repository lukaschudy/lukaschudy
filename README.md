### Hi there 👋 I'm Lukas.

**Ex-Professional League of Legends Player turned Quant.**
Currently pursuing a double-focus in **Economics & Mathematics** at the University of Groningen (RUG) and HKUST. Also spent last Summer doing Math/Stats at LSE.

My background in competitive esports taught me rapid decision-making, and now, I apply that rigor to **Probability Theory** and **low-latency engineering**.

* 🔭 **Current Focus:** Stochastic Models & Game Theory.
* 💻 **Primary Language:** **C++**. I prioritize C++ for its memory discipline and performance, though I use **Python** for data analysis.
* 🔜 **Coming Soon:** Open-source projects in Game Theory simulations.
